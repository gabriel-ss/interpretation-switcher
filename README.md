# Interpretation Switcher

Library to align different interpretations of the same song. A descriptive prototype of the alignment algorithm is available in Julia and the library itself is implemented in C with [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php).

## Building
Just make sure that the eigen3 directory is included in your compiler path and compile with:

```bash
make libsndalign.so
```
